Shinobu 0.4
===========

Shinobu is a minimalistic framework/CMS written in PHP5 and uses MySQLi
to store its data. My intention if not to provide a big, feature overloaded
system, but a simple system that provides some basic features and is easy to
extend (for a PHP developer) and easy to use.

Note: Shinobu is currently under development and it may happen that some
things do not work.
