Shinobu 0.4
===========

Shinobu is a minimalistic framework/CMS written in PHP5 and it uses MySQL,
PostgreSQL or SQLite (2/3) to store its data.  My intention if not to provide
a big, feature overloaded system, but a simple system that provides some
basic features and it easy to extend (for a PHP developer) and easy to use.

Note: Shinobu is currently under development and it may happen that some
things do not work.
