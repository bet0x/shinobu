 - Administration panel
    - Options
       - Localization settings

    * Time and date functions/helpers
       - Localization

      Probably something similar to: http://gitorious.org/fluxbb/fluxbb/blobs/master/include/email.php
 - Localization system
 * Documentation (API, tutorials/examples, usage)
 - Template engine
   Write one from scratch or use an existing one (must be fast and lightweight).
